## Project Overview

HealthAccess revolutionizes healthcare management by making medical information and services accessible to all patients. The platform provides multiple interaction methods including voice commands, high-contrast modes, and simplified interfaces, ensuring patients with disabilities can independently manage their healthcare.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest challenge was creating an interface that worked seamlessly with various assistive technologies while maintaining HIPAA compliance. We implemented a flexible accessibility layer that adapts to different user needs while ensuring secure access to sensitive medical information.
