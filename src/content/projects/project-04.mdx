## Project Overview

Accessible Learning Hub transforms online education by making it truly inclusive for all learners. The platform automatically adapts content presentation based on individual needs, supporting dyslexia, ADHD, visual impairments, and other learning differences through AI-driven personalization.

## Technical Challenges

The biggest challenge was creating a system that could dynamically adjust content presentation without losing educational value. We implemented an adaptive engine that modifies text layout, color schemes, and content pacing while maintaining curriculum integrity and learning objectives.
